        None


        This bundle adds two extra fields, both versions of the geoid. The Tigerline
        geoid, in the format used in Tigerline files, and a Civic Knowledge format,
        which uses base 62 to be more compact. These geoids are only defined for a
        limited set of the summary levels:


        * 20 Region

        * 30 Division

        * 40 State

        * 50 County

        * 60 County subdivision

        * 160 Place

        * 140 Tract

        * 150 Blockgroup'

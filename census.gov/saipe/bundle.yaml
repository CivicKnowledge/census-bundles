    summary: Model-based Small Area Income & Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) for School
        Districts, Counties, and States. These estimates combine data from administrative
        records, postcensal population estimates, and the decennial census with direct
        estimates from the American Community Survey to provide consistent and reliable
        single-year estimates. These model-based single-year estimates are more reflective
        of current conditions than multi-year survey estimates.
